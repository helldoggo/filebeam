Disk Usage CLI Tool – To-Do List
✅ Planning & Concept

Define core functionality: display folder/file sizes visually like FileLight with a ranger-style interface

Decide on terminal-based interface: aiming for dual-pane view (left: tree, right: contents)

Confirm language: Python

    Commit to personal learning experience (no full code requested)

📦 Tech Stack Decisions

Choose TUI library:

       Decided on Urwid


🗂 File Indexing Logic

Decide on indexing strategy:

       Chose folder-by-folder indexing to save RAM and CPU

       Implement folder-by-folder indexing logic

📊 Visual Design & Display

Design text-based usage bar (ASCII blocks or shaded blocks)

Optionally, design a grid that fills based on used disk space

    Add percentage and size data next to each item

⚙️ Program Functionality

Allow directory navigation using arrow keys or keybinds

Use os and shutil for:

Folder traversal

File size gathering

    Disk space (via shutil.disk_usage("/"))

Structure code with OOP:

    Create File/Folder classes to hold metadata

Display only contents of currently navigated directory

Accept folder path via CLI argument (via argparse)

Default to root (/) if no argument is provided

        Use os.chdir() to change the working directory

🧹 File Management Features

Implement delete functionality:

    Prompt for confirmation before deleting any file/folder

Handle exceptions for permission or failed deletes
